## Introduction
###  Introduction to a research question (what is the background on this subject; why does the question matter; who will it help; how has it been attempted to be answered)
  Interest in food traceability research has increased over the last few decades due to it's usefulness as a tool to enhance food safety and security measures. Traceability is the collection of data from various points in the value chain that provide a mechanism for tracking forward and tracing backward each step a food item takes in the value chain prior to reaching the consumer. The application of traceability methods can make targeting specific items that need to be removed from the market more efficient and accurate. 
  The movement and mixture of bulk products such as liquids, like milk or vegetable oil, and granular materials, like corn, soy beans, wheat, and rice, are complex and not well understood. Bulk items have been shown to confound current traceability methods, such as physical separation of different lots, defining and associating batches, radio frequency identification tagging (RFID), QR coding, and barcodes. Physical separation is not practical when it comes to the millions of bushels of grain harvested, stored, and transported throughout the midwest annually. These grain harvests must be stored in bulk storage facilities, called cooperatives or elevators, that purchase grain from producers and store it in their facility in anticipation of selling the grain to the markets that they serve. There is no way to keep grain harvested from Farm X separate from grain harvested from Farm Y; they are layered into the bins based on the management decisions made at the storage facility with respect to the quality and  

### Clear data analysis question 

### Clear identification of data inputs

### Clear identification of analysis methods, including a well documented workflow figure.  

### Additionally, I would like to see a written discussion of the following:
Incorporation of at least three topics relevant to this class  - what from the class did you use in this project and why might it be useful for research projects like this?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  Were there any assumptions or transformations needed?  Some topics discussed:  data wrangling; exploratory data analysis / summarizing data; identification of patterns and relationships; making predictions and decisions; text scraping; automation; scaling; randomization and bootstrapping; statistical analysis; ability to read and incorporate packages; supervised and unsupervised learning; cloud computing; using standard inputs; version control; how to manipulate multiple files with standard workflows; reproducible workflows, etc.

### How much does your analysis attain the FAIR principles? 
For example, what is the ability to automate and reproduce your analysis (if the file input were to change, could this analysis be reproduced and how easily?)  - how will someone else reproduce this analysis?  Is the data stored somewhere?  Can I reproduce the figures easily?

### Creation of one assignment based on your dataset for the class to complete - one can think of this of a task or homework assignment based on your project.


### Other things I will look for:

- Inclusion of statistical tools

- Publication of workflow in a version controlled manner (your code should be on github)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/htenboer/516x-tenboer/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
