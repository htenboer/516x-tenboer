## Introduction
###  Introduction to a research question (what is the background on this subject; why does the question matter; who will it help; how has it been attempted to be answered)
  Interest in food traceability research has increased over the last few decades due to it's usefulness as a tool to enhance food safety and security measures. Traceability is the collection of data from various points in the value chain that provide a mechanism for tracking forward and tracing backward each step a food item takes in the value chain prior to reaching the consumer. The application of traceability methods can make targeting specific items that need to be removed from the market more efficient and accurate. 

The movement and mixture of bulk products such as liquids, like milk or vegetable oil, and granular materials, like corn, soy beans, wheat, and rice, are complex and not well understood. Bulk items have been shown to confound current traceability methods, such as physical separation of different lots, defining and associating batches, radio frequency identification tagging (RFID), QR coding, and barcodes. Physical separation is not practical when it comes to the millions of bushels of grain harvested, stored, and transported throughout the midwest annually. These grain harvests must be stored in bulk storage facilities, called cooperatives or elevators, that purchase grain from producers and store it in their facility in anticipation of selling the grain to the markets that they serve. There is no way to keep grain harvested from Farm X separate from grain harvested from Farm Y; they are layered into the bins based on the management decisions made at the storage facility with respect to the quality and condition of the grain. 
  
In my research I am investigating the amount of mixing that occurs as grain from various source-lots is loaded into and then removed from a storage bin. Currently there are 3 basic assumptions that can be made about the composition of the grain leaving the bin: 
  1. The grain is leaving the bin in first-in-first-out (FIFO) flow behavior;
  2. The grain is leaving the bin in last-in-first-out (LIFO) flow behavior; and
  3. Each load that leaves the bin is an equal mixture of all the source-lots in the bin. 

As shown in the image below, these assumptions are not accurate because grain forms a natural hopper as gravity feed is commenced and as upper layers flow through lower layers a great deal of unquantified mixing occurs. Quantification of lot mixing due to granular flow characteristics could allow for the development of technology that can make predictions of grain load composition and generate a more accurate label. In the case of a recall situation increased label accuracy with respect to bulk products would provide an avenue for the efficient removal of contaminated products. Increased efficiency would save time and money, and allow for more uncontaminated food to remain in the market.

### Research Question
In my quest to understand more about the impacts of my research into improving traceability in granular materials I have sought out data that can describe the impacts of food contamination. Specifically, I am interested in eventually being able to calculate the risks involved by guaging the severity, based on the reason for the recall and the duration of the recall. For each of the recall situations I can make projections about how an improved label could decrease the risk exposure. I downloaded a file consisting of recall items from the FDA with the intention of uncovering information about the causes and duration of recalls involving corn. After spending some time looking through the dataset I was able to determine some questions that we would be able to answer using this data. 

1. How great is the impact of these recalls? As in, how many states are affected in each recall?
2. What states are more likely to initiate a recall?
3. Which states are most commonly affected?
4. Which years had the greatest number of recalls?
5. Were there certain months that tended to have higher recall counts than others?

The dataset used in this exercise was downloaded from the FDA website. It is a collection of recall data from the last several years and it includes information about the product types, product distribution patterns, recall date and state that initiated the recall, and more. I developed a project flowchart to guide this exercise as indicated in the image below.

### Discussion:
Incorporation of at least three topics relevant to this class  - what from the class did you use in this project and why might it be useful for research projects like this?  What are the advantages and disadvantages?  Were there any assumptions or transformations needed?  Some topics discussed:  data wrangling; exploratory data analysis / summarizing data; identification of patterns and relationships; making predictions and decisions; text scraping; automation; scaling; randomization and bootstrapping; statistical analysis; ability to read and incorporate packages; supervised and unsupervised learning; cloud computing; using standard inputs; version control; how to manipulate multiple files with standard workflows; reproducible workflows, etc.

### FAIR principles: 
For example, what is the ability to automate and reproduce your analysis (if the file input were to change, could this analysis be reproduced and how easily?)  - how will someone else reproduce this analysis?  Is the data stored somewhere?  Can I reproduce the figures easily?
